# Calibration

This project is the calibration system for the Stroke VR project.
Will be in a form of a mini-game that has the player extend their arms to their full range of motion.
This could also give us an option for spacing (box and blocks) and the choice for left and right handed.

Some idea's for mini-games:

	Instruction based (Move you arm as high as it can go) not really a game.
	Could also incororate zones (elbow, forearm, grabbing) and move them when the zone/sign activates
  
  
Data will be saved in playerPrefs for now so the other games can access them, however this will be changed.


So far the positioning and part of the left arm vertical is complete.
The setup is in a house room with a TV.

The confirmation buttons include both Oculus touch Index Triggers as well as the space bar (in case the use can't grip very well the physician would do it for them).
